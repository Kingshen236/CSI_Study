# Purpose
Hello, this is an in-depth collection of all the lessons learned in the Chico 2025 CS Summer program, divided into the various coding languages used in the program 
## Coding Languages
### JavaScript
JavaScript is a versatile, dynamically typed programming language used for interactive web applications, supporting both client-side and server-side development, and integrating seamlessly with HTML, CSS, and a rich standard library.
### Java
Java is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming language. It is intended to let programmers write once and run anywhere, meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without requiring recompilation.
### HTML
Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.
### CSS
Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
### C#
C# is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented, and component-oriented programming disciplines.
